## Step 1: Setting Up Your Prompt Engineering Environment

You are a professional learning to use AI tools effectively. Your goal is to master prompt engineering techniques that will make you more productive in your daily work, whether you're writing content, analyzing data, or solving problems.

In this step, you'll learn to set up a codespace to start crafting and testing effective prompts.

### 📖 Theory: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

> [!NOTE]
> Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models. A well-written prompt can mean the difference between getting a vague response and getting exactly what you need.

**Key Benefits of Good Prompt Engineering:**

- **Precision**: Get specific, actionable responses
- **Efficiency**: Reduce back-and-forth iterations with AI
- **Consistency**: Reliable results for similar tasks
- **Control**: Guide AI to follow your preferred style and format
- **Productivity**: Accomplish complex tasks faster

### ⌨️ Activity: Set Up Your Prompt Engineering Workspace

1. **Open your codespace** if you have not already opened it up in a new tab, and ensure GitHub Copilot is active (look for the Copilot icon in the status bar)

2. **Create a new prompt document**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
   - Type "New File" and select it
   - Save the file as `my-prompts.md`

3. **Test GitHub Copilot for prompt creation**:
   - Start typing: `# My Prompt Engineering Collection`
   - Press `Enter` and begin typing: `## Zero-Shot Prompts`
   - Notice how Copilot suggests relevant content
   - Press tab to accept the suggestion and save the file

4. **Write your first prompt**:
   
   In your `my-prompts.md` file, add this content to practice prompt engineering:
   
   ```markdown
   # My Prompt Engineering Collection
   
   ## Zero-Shot Prompt Example
   
   **Prompt:**
   Write a professional email to a client explaining that you need more information for the new WhatsApp project to do a thorough requirement analysis.
   
   **AI Response:**
   [Paste the AI's response here when you test this prompt]
   ```
   **Practice Activity:** 
   - Test these prompts with GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot
   - Copy the AI responses and paste them in the designated areas

5. **Commit and push your workspace setup**:
   
   Now let's save your progress to GitHub. Copy and paste these commands one by one:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Set up prompt engineering workspace structure"
   ```
   
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > **Git Best Practice**: In professional environments, it's recommended to create feature branches and use pull requests instead of pushing directly to the main branch. However, for this learning exercise, pushing directly to main is perfectly fine!
   
   **What these commands do:**
   - `git add .` - Stages all your new files for commit
   - `git commit -m "message"` - Creates a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message
   - `git push origin main` - Uploads your changes to GitHub on the main branch
   
   ✅ **Success!** Your workspace is now saved to GitHub and ready for prompt engineering practice!

   If everything went well. Mona will give you your next task.
